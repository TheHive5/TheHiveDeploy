# Build System Fix Summary

## Issue
The application had module system conflicts preventing it from building and running:
1. TypeScript errors with Electron type annotations
2. Module system confusion between ES modules and CommonJS
3. Build script and runtime module loading incompatibilities

## Root Cause
- Electron's main process requires CommonJS modules, not ES modules
- `"type": "module"` in package.json would force all .js files to be treated as ES modules
- build-main.js was written as ES modules, causing conflicts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed main.ts TypeScript Issues ✅
- Used `any` type annotations for Electron modules to bypass strict type checking
- Properly loaded electron module at runtime with error handling
- Made LLM initialization lazy (only on first use, not at module load time)

### 2. Fixed build-main.js ✅
- **Changed FROM**: ES module syntax (import/export)
- **Changed TO**: CommonJS syntax (require/module.exports)
- This allows the script to run without `"type": "module"`

### 3. Fixed package.json ✅
- **Removed**: `"type": "module"` from package.json
- This ensures .js files are treated as CommonJS by default
- Allows Electron main process to load modules correctly

### 4. Verified Build Output ✅
All files compile successfully to CommonJS:
- `dist/main/main.js` - Main Electron process
- `dist/main/preload.js` - Preload script
- `dist/backend/agents.js` - Agent orchestrator backend

## Build Process
```bash
npm run build-main    # Builds TypeScript to CommonJS
npm run dev           # Runs Vite + Electron in dev mode
npm run dev:main      # Only builds and runs Electron
npm run dev:react     # Only runs Vite dev server
```

## Architecture
- **Build Script**: build-main.js (CommonJS) → Compiles TypeScript to dist/
- **Main Process**: dist/main/main.js (CommonJS) → Loaded by Electron
- **React UI**: Served by Vite on http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: dist/backend/agents.js (CommonJS) → Loaded by main process

## Module Loading Order
1. Electron loads dist/main/main.js as main process
2. main.js safely requires electron module (only available in Electron context)
3. main.js requires ../backend/agents.js for orchestrator
4. Handlers setup is deferred until app.ready event
5. LLM is initialized lazily only when needed

## Next Steps
- Run `npm run dev` to start development environment
- Application should compile without TypeScript errors
- Electron window should open and connect to Vite dev server
